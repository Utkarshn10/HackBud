# HackBud

Are you a passionate hacker looking to participate in thrilling hackathons but struggling to find the ideal teammate or team?

Look no further! I am excited to present HackBud, a groundbreaking web app that I have developed to connect like-minded individuals and facilitate collaboration in the hackathon community. HackBud is built as a part of Appwrite and Hashnode Hackathon. Therefore I call it "An app built for Hackathon in a Hackathon üöÄ".
